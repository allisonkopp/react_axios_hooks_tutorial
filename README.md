## Gif App

1. Fetch gifs from the given url and render them on the screen. While the gifs are loading, you should show the <p>Loading..</p> node
2. Create the search component that will search for gifs when the user types in a search bar then clicks submit. The gifs that appear should match what the user searches for
3. Write some logic that will render the NoGifs component when there are no gifs that match the user's search
